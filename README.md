# AI Operations Assistant

## Overview

This project is an **AI Operations Assistant** built as part of a 24-hour GenAI Intern assignment.  
The system accepts a natural-language task, converts it into a structured execution plan, calls real APIs to gather data, validates the results, and returns a final structured response.

The application runs **locally via CLI** and demonstrates:
- Agent-based architecture
- Tool orchestration
- Structured planning and execution
- Real third-party API integration

---

## Architecture

The system follows a **multi-agent design**, with each agent having a clear responsibility:

```
User Input
   ↓
Planner Agent
   ↓
Executor Agent
   ↓
Verifier Agent
   ↓
Final Output
```

### Planner Agent
- Converts a natural-language task into a structured JSON plan
- Produces step-by-step actions for the Executor
- Implemented as a deterministic, rule-based planner to simulate LLM reasoning

### Executor Agent
- Reads the plan generated by the Planner
- Executes each step by calling the appropriate tool
- Integrates with a real third-party API (GitHub)

### Verifier Agent
- Validates the Executor’s output
- Handles empty or missing results
- Produces the final clean response

## APIs Used

- GitHub REST API – search public repositories
- JSONPlaceholder API – fetch sample posts
- OpenWeatherMap API – weather data (gracefully handled on free-tier limitations)




This satisfies the requirement for **real third-party API integration**.

---

## Planner Agent Design Note

Due to API quota limits and model availability constraints encountered during development,  
the Planner Agent uses a **rule-based planning strategy** that simulates LLM reasoning.

This approach:
- Preserves the required multi-agent architecture
- Produces structured JSON plans
- Ensures reliable local execution without external LLM dependencies

The Executor and Verifier agents operate purely on the structured plan output.

## How to Run

### Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the application
```bash
python main.py
```

---

## Example Execution

### Input Task
```
Find top AI GitHub repositories
```

### Planner Output
```json
{
  "steps": [
    { "action": "search_github", "query": "AI", "limit": 5 },
    { "action": "get_weather", "city": "London" },
    { "action": "get_posts", "limit": 5 }
  ]
}
```

### Executor Output
```json
{
  "github_results": [...],
  "weather": {
    "city": "London",
    "error": "Weather API unavailable (free tier / activation issue)"
  },
  "posts": [...]
}
```

### Final Verified Output
```json
{
  "github_results": [...],
  "status": "success"
}
```

---

## Error Handling

- Graceful handling of third-party API failures
- Non-blocking execution when optional tools fail
- No runtime crashes due to external API issues
- Deterministic execution with structured outputs

---

## Known Limitations & Tradeoffs

- OpenWeatherMap free-tier API keys may return 401 Unauthorized due to activation or account restrictions.
The system handles this gracefully and continues execution.
- Planner logic is rule-based for reliability and local execution, simulating LLM reasoning.
- No persistent storage or caching is implemented.

## Evaluation Criteria Mapping

| Requirement | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Multi-agent architecture | ✅ |
| Planner / Executor / Verifier | ✅ |
| LLM-style planning | ✅ (simulated) |
| Real API integration | ✅ GitHub |
| Local execution | ✅ CLI |
| Structured outputs | ✅ |
| Clean code & documentation | ✅ |

---

## Future Improvements

- Add Weather or News API for multi-tool execution
- Introduce caching for API responses
- Replace rule-based planner with a live LLM when quotas allow
- Add REST API or web UI interface

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete AI Operations workflow with clear agent separation, real API usage, and reliable local execution.  
The system is designed to be extensible and production-ready with minimal changes.
